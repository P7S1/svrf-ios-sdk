     the [ARKit blend shape naming](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation)
     will be affected.
     - Note: The 3D animation terms "blend shapes", "morph targets", and "pose morphs" are often used interchangeably.

        - blendShapes: A dictionary of *ARFaceAnchor* blend shape locations and weights.
